# Crude-Jumper

  **Overview:**
  
The file archive of a school senior project.

Thing is, I'm not super ahead of the game when it comes to programming/coding, so almost all of the effort comes from finding tutorials online.

this is the playlist I use primarily for the features of the game. However, I use various other videos to figure out coyote time, drift, and all that crap.


  **The Plan:**
  
After I finish this simply for the senior project, I'll likely be expanding it to a full game, and use some of my free time after graduation to refine my programming/coding knowledge.


  **Art:**
  
The full vision of the game is for it to be akin to like, Narita Boy or Wario Land 4.
The character, Floyd, was designed initially to look like a Rocky & Bullwinkle character,but I've since moved on to making him just look like a goofy little guy.
While I don't consider myself to be great at sprite work, I'm happy with how the sprites turned out, and I designed the tiles to reflect the simplistic style of Floyd's character.


  **The End Project:**
  
What I want out of this project is to have a very basic understanding of how to make a game, just as a first step into what I want as my career. 
The idea is that I can show my ideas and work to other game developers in hopes of landing in a developer group, if the one I'm currently in falls apart, or can't financially support me, once we get to that step.


  **The "Story":**
  
Floyd is a detective for an agency called "The Underwatch" that operates in a city that has been overrun by crime.
The city spans across the entire planet, so there's plenty of crime to look out for. 
Floyd himself doesn't say much, but has obvious opinions about matters.
His arch-nemesis, Priv Grinny, is a higher ranking detective at The Underwatch, and is often assigned cases with Floyd as a partner.
Priv Grinny (Priv for short) likes to abuse the power he has with being a head detective, and often uses his high status to get what he wants.
Floyd has caught him multiple times commiting petty crimes, but doesn't have sufficient evidence to prove so, because Priv is very thorough when he commits crime.

So Floyd has taken it upon himself to prove that Priv is guilty.
